    <h1 id="semi_title"><strong>Here you will find all of my Map visual projects!</strong></h1>
    <p><a href="https://p5js.org/">p5</a> is a JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, beginners, and educators. Using its drawing functionalities I was able to create the following creative projects and learned some JavaScript along the way! Feel free to use and modify any and all of my code for your own projects. If you would like to know more about any individual project feel free to contact me.<br></p>
    <p> To access my projects hover over the <strong>"Assignments"</strong> & <strong>"Workshops"</strong> tabs and select them from the drop-down menu. These projects were part of my ART22 class at the University of California, Santa Barbara & were developed on a weekly basis; with assignments being 'over-the-weekend' projects, and workshops being quick code crunches between lectures.</p>
